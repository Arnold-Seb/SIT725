# SIT725 Week 7 â€“ Socket.IO Demo

This project extends my SIT725 application by adding real-time communication with Socket.IO. The task was to set up a server that pushes updates to all connected clients and then display those updates live on the web page.

ðŸŽ¯ What this project does

Uses Express and MongoDB for the backend.

Integrates Socket.IO on top of the existing server.

The server generates a random number every second and broadcasts it to all connected clients.

On the front end, the number is displayed under the cards section and updates instantly without refreshing the page.

This exercise shows how easy it is to add real-time behaviour to a Node.js app.
